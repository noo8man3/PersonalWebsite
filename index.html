                <p>
                    This Java program spams UDP packets at a user-designated IP address and port number. 
                    JavaFX is used heavily to deliver easily readable analytics and provides a crisp, clean 
                    user interface.

                    This Java program performs a dictionary attack on a hashed password file. JavaFX is 
                    used to simplify the process of selecting text files and initializing the attack once 
                    said files are selected.

                    <p>
                        I started my journey in higher education at Suffolk County Community College where I 
                        studied for three years and graduated (twice), obtaining an 
                        <abbr title="Associate in Arts">A.A.</abbr> in General Studies and an 
                        <abbr title="Associate in Science">A.S.</abbr> in Computer Science. Afterwards, I decided 
                        to attend St. Joseph's College in Patchogue, NY. I graduated with a 
                        <abbr title="Bachelor in Science">B.S.</abbr> in Mathematics/Computer Science program 
                        with a 3.9 GPA. While at St. Joseph's, I became a member of the Programming Team and 
                        went to competition in the Bronx.

                    <p>
                        My mission to to obtain gainful employment in the technology sector where I can grow 
                        professionally and learn the trade from more experienced developers. Ultimately, I just 
                        love solving puzzles and problems alike. While entry-level, I believe my passion for 
                        problem solving along with my ability to learn quickly can supplant my lack of experience, 
                        making me an asset to any firm.

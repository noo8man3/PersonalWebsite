                <p>
                    This Java program spams UDP packets at a user-designated IP address and port number. 
                    JavaFX is used heavily to deliver easily readable analytics and provides a crisp, clean 
                    user interface.

                <p class="desktop-text">
                    This Java program performs a dictionary attack on a hashed password file. JavaFX is 
                    used to simplify the process of selecting text files and initializing the attack once 
                    said files are selected.

                    you to change them.

        <h4>Education</h4>
        <img src="sju.jpg" class="about-pic" />
        <p>
            I began my journey in higher education at Suffolk County Community College where I graduated 
            twice, obtaining an A.A. in General Studies and an A.S. in Computer Science. Afterwards, I 
            stayed local and attended St. Joseph's College (now St. Joseph's University) where I graduated
            with a B.S. in Mathematics/Computer Science. Through hard work (and luck), I managed to keep
            a 3.9 GPA.

        <h4>Mission</h4>
        <img src="handshake.webp" class="about-pic"/>
        <p>
            My mission is to obtain gainful employment in the tech industry, preferably as a Software 
            Developer. I throughly enjoy solving problems and puzzles alike, and I believe my willingness 
            to learn and ability to do so quickly will be an asset to any firm.
